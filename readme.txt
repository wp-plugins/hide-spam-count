Hide the annoying spam count from the Dashboard.

== Description ==

Whenever I visit my site's dashboard, the first thing I see is the bold red Spam count.

Instead of wasting time deleting spam comments, I prefer to let Akismet do that automatically, so I don't need to see how many spam comments there are.

This little plugin simply hides that part.
